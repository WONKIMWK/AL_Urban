## Data Description
### Monitor Data
PM monitor characteristics come from EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) for the years 2001 to 2013.

### Satellite Data
Measure of atmospheric particle pollution (hereby "aerosol"). Data came from the National aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imagining Spectroradiometer (MODIS) algorithem.

### Grid Squares Data
Data contain a lot of grid squares data, that should be treated through ArcGIS. Since Author provide data which are already modified in ArcGIS, I'll use those modified file first and will try to use ArcGIS if I have enough time.
