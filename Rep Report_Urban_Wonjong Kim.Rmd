This paper is a replication report of Zou(2022), which shows the effect of intermittent monitoring of environmental standard on polluting activities. Among the results, this paper shows replication result of figure 2 in Zou(2022), which shows pollution gap between on-monitor day and off-monitor days.

## Data Description
### Monitor Data
PM monitor characteristics come from EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) for the years 2001 to 2013.

### Satellite Data
Measure of atmospheric particle pollution (hereby "aerosol"). Data came from the National aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imagining Spectroradiometer (MODIS) algorithm.
